The JupyterHub is a way to access Python Notebooks and RStudio without needing to install anything on your personal devices.

The content covered in these slides is also in a [video format on MS Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/cdac6c6d-0a61-4cf1-843b-9c0b0c8b22ca) if you would prefer to watch it there. (There is no spoken audio.)

### Logging in

.left-column[
.midi[
1. Go to [jupyter.utoronto.ca](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca).
1. If you *are NOT logged in to your UofT account* in that browser, click 'Log in to Continue' and log in through the single sign on as usual.
1. If you *ARE logged in to your UofT account* in that browser, **select RStudio** before clicking 'Log in to start. This will open RStudio right away and you can skip the next step.
1. Click 'New' and select RStudio from the dropdown menu.

### Setting up your folders

.small[.footnote[Note: if you're using R projects (see next slide) a lot, I'd actually suggest naming assignment/activity folders as follows: **coursecode_assignment**, e.g. "STA303_a1". *Why?* Then when you look through recent project from the project menu, you don't want to have 3 different "Assignment1"s. Projects are automatically named after their folder.]]

.left-column[
- If you're using the JupyterHub for several courses, you'll want to come up with a sensible file and folder structure.
]

.right-column[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/files.gif")
```

### R projects

.left-column[
- R projects can be a really helpful part of your workflow. 
- Learn more about them here in [*Chapter 8 of R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html). 
- See the footnote on the previous slide for a consideration when naming your files. 
]

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project.gif")
```

]

---
### Opening new files

.left-column[
- You can create a new R Notebook or other R Markdown files or an R script from the Files menu.
- RMarkdown is a great way to have your code, visualizations and commentary all in one place. Learn more in the [*Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and download the handy [**cheatsheet**](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Artwork by @allison_horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown_wizards.png")
```

---
### Uploading files

.left-column[
- Upload data and other required files in the **Files** pane.
- If you have multiple files, zip/compress them locally before uploading them. They will automatically be unzipped for you. You can't select multiple files in the uploader.
]

.right-column[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/upload.gif")
```

---
### Using a sharing link

.left-column[
- If you have been given a sharing link, an are logged in to your UofT account, clicking it should open RStudio for you.
  - [Here is an example](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Felb0%2Fjupyterexample&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=main).
- You'll notice that the same files that were previously open will be opened again, not necessarily the file you want. 
- Naviagte to 'Home' and you'll see the new folder there.
]

.right-column[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sharinglink.gif")
```

]

---
### Moving files

.left-column[
- You can move files and folders around to keep things organised.
- Click 'More' in the Files pane.
- Navigate to where you want to move the file and click 'Choose'.
]

.right-column[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/moving.gif")
```

]

---
### Knitting and exporting files

.left-column[
.midsmall[
- When working with an R Markdown file (.Rmd) would will usually need to **Knit** to another format, such as PDF or HTML.
- Click the 'Knit' button, or if that isn't showing, there should be a down arrow next to 'Preview' that lets you choose the knitted file type.
- Tick the files you wish to export (i.e. download to your personal machine).
- Go to the 'More' menu in the Files pane and select 'Export'.
- If exporting multiple files, they will export as a .zip file. I suggest giving it a meaningful name and then clicking 'Download'.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/exporting.gif")
```

]

### Troubleshooting

.left-column[
.midi[
- Your session will time out after a period of inactivity. Refresh to reconnect.
- You can't have multiple RStudio windows open with the JupyterHub. You'll get a message that the old session has been disconnected when you open a new one.
- If you get out of RStudio you can get back in through the 'New' menu and then navigate using the Files pane or open a recent project.
